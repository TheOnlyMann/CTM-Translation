Having slipped from the caster’s control, it is running wild, and the only way to stop it—the Green-Soul Rite—is incomplete and ineffective against overly powerful beings.

    "soso.string.4203": "I also feel deep sorrow over the death of our Security Corps comrades... he is probably hurting far more than I am.",
    "soso.string.4204": "As for why the ritual failed—perhaps I have a lead.",
    "soso.string.4205": "It might be... no... that would be too disrespectful... I should speak only after I’m more certain.",
    "soso.string.4206": "My love for this town runs as deep as for the Sacred Tree; I will not give up until the very end.",
    "soso.string.4207": "Accompany me once more—let’s challenge the demonfolk again.",
    "soso.string.4208": "And this time we will bring him down together!",
    "soso.string.4209": "...We failed to kill the demonfolk......",
    "soso.string.4210": "Through See‑Through Magic, I saw... the demonfolk’s whole body was filled with the Sacred Tree’s mana.",
    "soso.string.4211": "...No, not only that; even the nearby undead were the same.",
    "soso.string.4212": "Before long they will probably awaken once again.",
    "soso.string.4213": "Those 「undead」 are not undead in the true sense.",
    "soso.string.4214": "They are mindless corpses forcibly restored by the Sacred Tree’s power.",
    "soso.string.4215": "That demonfolk is the best proof—foolishly charging straight at humans.",
    "soso.string.4216": "It has completely lost both swordsmanship and the intellect to cast magic.",
    "soso.string.4217": "Please—I will definitely catch the one who exploits the Sacred Tree’s power.",
    "soso.string.4218": "Stand with me at the forefront as heroes who felled the demonfolk.",
    "soso.string.4219": "Do not let it become known that our Sacred Tree has been exploited.",
    "soso.string.4220": "Are you going to deliver a letter to the eastern Fortress City ─ Seimen？",
    "soso.string.4221": "Perhaps... just right. May I ask you to do something at the same time？",
    "soso.string.4222": "Regarding those undead... no... corpses, our Holy‑Tree Church has already conducted some research.",
    "soso.string.4223": "Even if their bodies are chopped into eight large pieces, they gradually regrow and restore.",
    "soso.string.4224": "By the ample Sacred Tree power suffusing this land.",
    "soso.string.4225": "Especially when Sacred Tree magic is used to infuse them with life force, they can even instantly repair their bodies and go berserk.",
    "soso.string.4226": "They are corpses forcibly pieced together by excessive healing power, driven only by instinct.",
    "soso.string.4227": "Therefore, if there is demonic power that suppresses life force, perhaps they can be dealt with.",
    "soso.string.4228": "Seventy years ago, after the Demon King—the king of the demonfolk—arose, the Human–Demon War broke out.",
    "soso.string.4229": "Its foremost front line was the Fortress City ─ Seimen where the current lord, Lanwang, now sits.",
    "soso.string.4230": "There were rumors during the war that the demonfolk used a special weapon.",
    "soso.string.4231": "Weapons forged from Green‑Soul Stone, a special ore that can be mined only in demonfolk territory.",
    "soso.string.4232": "Tough and sharp... and not only that—they also possessed the power to seize the life of the living.",
    "soso.string.4233": "By leveraging the properties of Green‑Soul Stone, we might be able to truly kill those corpses.",
    "soso.string.4234": "Seek Green‑Soul Stone in Seimen, whether finished weapons or freshly mined ore.",
    "soso.string.4235": "Bring them back; our Church will certainly prepare generous rewards.",
    "soso.string.4236": "...Aside from these, you should know the real reason I called you—how are the preparations？",
    "soso.string.4237": "...Much obliged; you even found a method to deal with the undead.",
    "soso.string.4238": "From the present situation it is a method worth trying; can’t you divulge who gave the information...？",
    "soso.string.4239": "...No, I won’t blame you for that; you’ve done very well. Here is the promised reward.",
    "soso.string.4240": "Next is the follow‑up portion of the commission...",
    "soso.string.4241": "To put it plainly, this curse ritual is a life‑force control ritual.",
    "soso.string.4242": "For priests of the Holy‑Tree Church, it isn’t very difficult.",
    "soso.string.4243": "The issue is the ritual site—the convergence point of the Sacred Tree’s mana.",
    "soso.string.4244": "Without a doubt that points to the Holy‑Spirit Tree Altar at the end of the Forest of Lost Paths...",
    "soso.string.4245": "The scar left by the Demon King seventy years ago... is too heavy for humankind.",
    "soso.string.4246": "Back then in the Human–Demon War, what most offended the Demon King was the Sacred Tree.",
    "soso.string.4247": "Mithril, tree‑arts... all the power by which humans could contend with the demonfolk came from the Sacred Tree.",
    "soso.string.4248": "The front kept retreating; human territory was repeatedly plundered by the demonfolk.",
    "soso.string.4249": "But being close to the Sacred Tree increased human strength and turned the front into a stalemate.",
    "soso.string.4250": "Dissatisfied with this, the Demon King led the eight clans’ chiefs ─ the eight Demon Generals,and forcibly broke through the lines.",
    "soso.string.4251": "In the end he was struck down by the hero in the Tree‑Capital ─ Woden,but humankind also lost many things because of it.",
    "soso.string.4252": "The hero, the Pope of the Holy‑Tree Church, and the entire Holy Capital were lost,and all the Demon Generals were allowed to escape.",
    "soso.string.4253": "The method of passing through the Forest of Lost Paths and the key phrase to open the altar gate also vanished in this war.",
    "soso.string.4254": "After hearing your description of the undead nest, I think that must be it.",
    "soso.string.4255": "The undead nest is the Holy Capital ─ Woden; all the secrets lie in the city’s depths.",
    "soso.string.4256": "I’m asking you to break into the depths to investigate; whether the undead problem can be resolved rests on you.",
    "soso.string.4257": "...Was the map of the Forest of Lost Paths taken away？",
    "soso.string.4258": "That isn’t a bad thing; at least it proves it exists. We can ask the stationed army for it later.",
    "soso.string.4259": "But why？ Why would the Imperial Army seek a way to the Holy‑Spirit Tree Altar？",
    "soso.string.4260": "Ah, are you serious？",
    "soso.string.4261": "So the Imperial Army are the enemy, and the demonfolk are already stirring to resolve the aberration？",
    "soso.string.4262": "...Looks like you’re serious... then I hope you can trust me a bit more.",
    "soso.string.4263": "Trusting my friends is only natural.",
    "soso.string.4264": "So for the map, we’ve now confirmed the Imperial Army holds a copy.",
    "soso.string.4265": "What we lack is the gate’s key phrase.",
    "soso.string.4266": "You once mentioned... seeing a gorgeously dressed zombie in the depths of the nest.",
    "soso.string.4267": "That is likely the undead transformed from the previous Pope; I intend to try to revive him.",
    "soso.string.4268": "You still remember the tragedy that happened that day in the Root‑Burrow Deep Pit, right.",
    "soso.string.4269": "The Sacred Tree’s mana refined through ritual for purification was instead absorbed by the undead.",
    "soso.string.4270": "Not only did it fail to purify them; it instead greatly strengthened the undead.",
    "soso.string.4271": "If we pour this immense Sacred Tree mana into the Pope.",
    "soso.string.4272": "Maximize restoration of the body; perhaps even the brain can be repaired along with it.",
    "soso.string.4273": "Restore his reason; then we can learn the opening key phrase of the altar’s gate.",
    "soso.string.4274": "Come with me to the depths of the nest; I will attempt to revive him.",
    "soso.string.4275": "You’re back! Seeing you looked pensive, I left you there alone...",
    "soso.string.4276": "Before the Pope gave the key phrase, he seemed to glance at you... did you pick up something from the ancient capital？",
    "soso.string.4277": "In any case, that was a big help; now to reach the sanctum we only need to obtain the map of the Forest of Lost Paths.",
    "soso.string.4278": "From what you said, the map is currently in the hands of the stationed legion...",
    "soso.string.4279": "I will try to approach Biao Su in the capacity of a Holy‑Tree Church bishop; come along as well.",
    "soso.string.4280": "Alas, judging by your intel, the chance they will hand over the map is slim to none....",
    "soso.string.4281": "Besides this path, is it necessary to find other means....",
    "soso.string.4282": "I didn’t expect they would even drop the pretense....",
    "soso.string.4283": "I will protest to the Empire through my authority on this matter.",
    "soso.string.4284": "However, by then it may already be too late.",
    "soso.string.4285": "The forces entrenched here receiving mithril ore... and undead troops modified by the Sacred Tree’s mana will only grow stronger.",
    "soso.string.4286": "By then even the elite‑packed Imperial Royal Guard Knights may be unable to repel them...",
    "soso.string.4287": "However... it is not too late yet... as long as we hold the ritual we can dispel the curse of undeath.",
    "soso.string.4288": "Wipe away everything they have accumulated and leave the night raid to you...",
    "soso.string.4289": "The stationed camp has only just been set up; it’s a mixed crowd, with teams often being shifted back and forth with Seimen.",
    "soso.string.4290": "Presumably they haven’t yet established a sound management system; go strike the personnel of the stationed legion.",
    "soso.string.4291": "Then strip off their uniforms and wear them yourself, disguising yourself as one of them.",
    "soso.string.4292": "Then get your hands on the map.",
    "soso.string.4293": "Looks like it worked.",
    "soso.string.4294": "Do you have something you want to say？",
    "soso.string.4295": "...I was negligent; I should have realized that in the Empire’s heartland...",
    "soso.string.4296": "the appearance of an undead formed from a demonfolk’s remains is exceedingly abnormal...",
    "soso.string.4297": "Nor had I considered why, though the Pope’s remains were found in the Holy Capital ─ Woden...",
    "soso.string.4298": "we never found the remains of the Demon King who fell at that final battleground...",
    "soso.string.4299": "It never occurred to me that the demonfolk undead in Hafos Village would be the Demon King’s remains...",
    "soso.string.4300": "I should have had you deliver a fatal blow with a Green‑Soul weapon the moment you returned.",
    "soso.string.4301": "Thinking about it now won’t help... the Demon King is an abnormal existence, a walking calamity...",
    "soso.string.4302": "Such a powerful individual could survive even after the curse ritual; leaving behind any medium of contamination would be our defeat.",
    "soso.string.4303": "You did well to discover his presence before the ritual.",
    "soso.string.4304": "Search quickly! The thief shouldn’t have gotten far yet!",
    "soso.string.4305": "...I’ll go prepare the supplies needed to head for the Forest of Lost Paths.",
    "soso.string.4306": "We have to infiltrate once more.",
    "soso.string.4307": "This time we must eliminate the obstacle to the ritual... the Demon King’s undead, before it fully revives!",
    "soso.string.4308": "No... your outfit doesn’t look like a member of the stationed legion; like this you can’t infiltrate deeply...",
    "soso.string.4309": "Now that’s good! However you look, you’re a member of the stationed legion!",
    "soso.string.4310": "From here on it’s up to you to find where the map is...",
    "soso.string.4311": "So long as we hold and complete the ritual at the Holy‑Spirit Tree Altar, the victory is ours...",
    "soso.string.4312": "Looks like it succeeded... the Demon King was struck down, right？",
    "soso.string.4313": "...That’s a relief; though I don’t know how much the revived undead Demon King recovered, it must have been a hard fight...",
    "soso.string.4314": "I’ve deciphered the map of the Forest of Lost Paths... this forest is twisted by the Sacred Tree’s suffusing mana...",
    "soso.string.4315": "The immense power causes space to expand; the Forest of Lost Paths... is not as narrow as it appears to the eye...",
    "soso.string.4316": "Rather, it’s a vast place like another dimension.",
    "soso.string.4317": "Once lost you cannot escape... I’ve recorded the key points of the map... follow the guidance!",
    "soso.string.4318": "Ugh... you’re here—this is the deepest part of the Forest of Lost Paths...",
    "soso.string.4319": "Behind this massive gate lies the Holy‑Spirit Tree Altar...",
    "soso.string.4320": "Besides you I’ve found another person to help us...",
    "soso.string.4321": "Oh... long time no see; thank you for taking care of our village...",
    "soso.string.4322": "Though it’s a pity we didn’t retake the village, today all hardships will end...",
    "soso.string.4323": "Kadon... a Holy‑Tree Church priest of Hafos Village destroyed by the Lord of Seimen’s schemes...",
    "soso.string.4324": "One I believe is trustworthy...",
    "soso.string.4325": "Save the Sacred Tree...",
    "soso.string.4326": "Take back the village...",
    "soso.string.4327": "Today all our wishes will be fulfilled...",
    "soso.string.4328": "Step back a little... I’m going to open the gate...",
    "soso.string.4329": "Something’s odd with the gate unlock...",
    "soso.string.4330": "No... the unlocking itself succeeded... sounds a bit like a fairy tale......",
    "soso.string.4331": "According to the records, the Holy‑Spirit Tree Altar is an altar that enshrines and gathers Holy‑Spirits...",
    "soso.string.4332": "When the altar gate is unlocked, the Holy‑Spirits will open the gate as a welcome.",
    "soso.string.4333": "The gate is still firmly shut...",
    "soso.string.4334": "Have the Holy‑Spirits... rejected us？",
    "soso.string.4335": "Is it related to those people around us...？",
    "soso.string.4336": "Those are drifters... the final fate of those who entered the Forest of Lost Paths without a map...",
    "soso.string.4337": "If you don’t follow the correct road, once you enter you absolutely can’t get out...",
    "soso.string.4338": "Chaotic time and misaligned space—by no means speak to them...",
    "soso.string.4339": "If drawn into their time‑space, you will never return...",
    "soso.string.4340": "Isn’t that so... but regardless... we must go forward.",
    "soso.string.4341": "Mm... to resolve this aberration, no matter what, we have to advance...",
    "soso.string.4342": "Let’s go...",
    "soso.string.4343": ",to welcome a happy ending.",
    "soso.string.4344": "The follow‑up pursuit mission can no longer continue...",
    "soso.string.4345": "We were just a little short....",
    "soso.string.4346": "In this battle our army has already lost over seventy percent of its strength...",
    "soso.string.4347": "We no longer have the power to continue the pursuit...",
    "soso.string.4348": "And since we’ve retaken the mithril mine, the benefits of pressing deep are too few...",
    "soso.string.4349": "We must not give up here.",
    "soso.string.4350": "Reig is still discussing support... but it looks difficult.",
    "soso.string.4351": "To buy time we have to head to the Forest of Lost Paths as soon as possible...",
    "soso.string.4352": "Even after felling Biao Su, the curse is still spreading...",
    "soso.string.4353": "And... the curse’s embodied form—that great dragon—hasn’t been brought down yet.",
    "soso.string.4354": "My attacks only drove it back.",
    "soso.string.4355": "Striking now gives us the greatest chance of success...",
    "soso.string.4356": "As expected, talks fell through.",
    "soso.string.4357": "You don’t plan to stop here, do you",
    "soso.string.4358": "Of course... we will head again to the Holy‑Spirit Tree Altar and this time wipe out the curse.",
    "soso.string.4359": "That’s what you say... but didn’t you already fail？",
    "soso.string.4360": "That was ignorance of the enemy—we were caught off guard by interference!",
    "soso.string.4361": "Now that we know there’s an obstacle, we won’t be careless...",
    "soso.string.4362": "You’ve thought of some methods too, haven’t you...? Otherwise why prepare the core again？",
    "soso.string.4363": "...Because there’s no other choice, we can only try once more？",
    "soso.string.4364": "Haha, you really are reckless!",
    "soso.string.4365": "It’s fine—thanks to your preparations we can set out for the Forest of Lost Paths at once.",
    "soso.string.4366": "Set out when ready!",
    "soso.string.4367": "We absolutely will not fail this time!",
    "soso.string.4368": "This time we will absolutely succeed!",
    "soso.string.4369": "Rock‑Gallop〈whispering...〉: 「",
    "soso.string.4370": "But... is it really because there is no other way that we are repeating the same method again？",
    "soso.string.4371": "Assassin: 「",
    "soso.string.4372": "Lord Yuanchuan, please wait a moment.",
    "soso.string.4373": "Wait？ Still waiting...? Where’s Shunchang？ Why isn’t he here yet!",
    "soso.string.4374": "I’m not going to mind your situation; I only care whether your plan goes smoothly!",
    "soso.string.4375": "Th‑the plan... isn’t going very smoothly... but...",
    "soso.string.4376": "So it failed after all! I told you Shunchang isn’t a match for Lanwang. You just wouldn’t listen!",
    "soso.string.4377": "But...",
    "soso.string.4378": "No buts! Since you failed, we’ll proceed according to our plan!",
    "soso.string.4379": "We demonfolk will attack Seimen in two days without regard for anything!",
    "soso.string.4380": "!!!",
    "soso.string.4381": "Looks like a bug crawled in. Kill him—don’t make me do it myself.",
    "soso.string.4382": "Yes...!",
    "soso.string.4383": "We’ve been discovered! We have to hurry and run back!",
    "soso.string.4384": "Yo! The newbie that guy recommended？",
    "soso.string.4385": "Kid, you look pretty sturdy! Your name is....",
    "soso.string.4386": "Looking at your gear... looks like you seem to be....",
    "soso.string.4387": "Seems to be",
    "soso.string.4388": "？",
    "soso.string.4389": "【No】",
    "soso.string.4390": "You’ve come at just the right time!",
    "soso.string.4391": "Because monsters suddenly surged out of the “Root‑Burrow Deep Cavern” next door, and they’re giving us trouble.",
    "soso.string.4392": "As your entry test as a newcomer—just perfect...!",
    "soso.string.4393": "Go subjugate 10 “Mine Wraith‑Corpses”!",

    "soso.string.4397": "Come back to me after you defeat the “Mine Wraith‑Corpses”.",
    "soso.string.4398": "Oh! Looks like you’ve completed the quest—seeing the scars piled up on your weapon, just as expected...",
    "soso.string.4399": "A seasoned adventurer indeed! The Security Corps of the Town Under the Tree ─ Sno welcomes you!",
    "soso.string.4400": "These are the Security Corps uniforms and standard gear...",
    "soso.string.4401": "Perhaps you have better, more familiar gear—don’t worry! Just use it directly!",
    "soso.string.4402": "Wearing unsuitable gear only makes battle dangerous!",
    "soso.string.4403": "...By the way, did you get any strange materials from those monsters？",
    "soso.string.4404": "These materials are fine goods that can only be obtained near our Sno.",
    "soso.string.4405": "All thanks to the Sacred Tree’s blessing, we can collect these mana‑charged materials here!",
    "soso.string.4406": "By using these materials at our special Forging Station, you can craft even stronger gear!",
    "soso.string.4407": "This is the Recipe Book for the Forging Station; take a look!",
    "soso.string.4408": "As long as you gather the materials, you can forge good gear!",
    "soso.string.4409": "Yes... as long as you gather the materials!",
    "soso.string.4410": "But those damned monsters snatched the materials right from under our noses!",
    "soso.string.4411": "Our “Root‑Burrow Deep Cavern” was invaded by them and had to be sealed!",
    "soso.string.4412": "Don’t worry! The sealing won’t last long...",
    "soso.string.4413": "We’ve already prepared a Purification Unit to reclaim the cavern.",
    "soso.string.4414": "Ah! Take these materials to Rock‑Gallop at the Church.",

    "soso.string.4418": "Didn’t expect you to still be alive. No wonder you’re the one he recommended.",
    "soso.string.4419": "We lost quite a few people in this failed operation.",
    "soso.string.4420": "The next purification plan will likely be pushed back a lot.",
    "soso.string.4421": "Sorry about this for a newcomer like you.",

    "soso.string.4437": "Every single one of them is like that!",
    "soso.string.4438": "Sorry, I got carried away. Back to business—go find the Holy‑Tree Church priest of Hafos Village, Kadon.",

    "soso.string.4440": "Find out clearly what exactly happened in Hafos Village!",

    "soso.string.4446": "For the village’s safety we at least have to confirm the undead’s movements.",
    "soso.string.4447": "Earlier I already sent the warrior Duanxian to Hafos Village to monitor the undead.",
    "soso.string.4448": "Meet up with him and bring the intel back. Oh, right...",
    "soso.string.4449": "Before you go, you can stop by the first‑floor office to accept tasks issued to adventurers.",
    "soso.string.4450": "From them you can obtain Training Tokens and a bit of money.",
    "soso.string.4451": "It’s fine if you don’t finish within the time; it just counts as a failed quest.",
    "soso.string.4452": "Is that so—so that’s what Duanxian said.",
    "soso.string.4453": "According to the records, the demonfolk are an exceedingly powerful race.",
    "soso.string.4454": "They are strong physically, and their magic is first‑rate as well.",
    "soso.string.4455": "Though there are individual differences, even the weakest requires five seasoned warriors to possibly subjugate.",
    "soso.string.4456": "But we don’t have that many people...",
    "soso.string.4457": "Can you do it？",
    "soso.string.4458": "I’ll assign four people to reduce the number of monsters as much as possible.",
    "soso.string.4459": "You, I, and Duanxian will join up to slay the demon.",
    "soso.string.4460": "I know it’s reckless, but we have to do it. Can we？",
    "soso.string.4461": "I knew I wasn’t mistaken—let’s fight together!",
    "soso.string.4462": "Sigh... no—we can’t beat it at all.",
    "soso.string.4463": "Then what on earth is going on？",
    "soso.string.4464": "So... the monster threats in Hafos Village and the Root‑Burrow Deep Cavern are steadily increasing; if this goes on... we may have to... consider abandoning the village.",
    "soso.string.4465": "................",
    "soso.string.4466": "You ask why we don’t talk with Rock‑Gallop about the source of the demonfolk’s mysterious power？",
    "soso.string.4467": "Hmph, did you forget？ The Root‑Burrow Deep Cavern purification failed thanks to those Holy‑Tree Church priests.",
    "soso.string.4468": "Our Security Corps carved a path with blood and flesh to lead the priests to the deepest part.",
    "soso.string.4469": "But he repaid us by using a failed ritual.",
    "soso.string.4470": "So many of my comrades... my brothers‑in‑arms... were lost like that.",
    "soso.string.4471": "And he doesn’t even know the reason the ritual failed.",
    "soso.string.4472": "Let’s go! If you want to ask, go ask him. I’m very disappointed in Rock‑Gallop.",
    "soso.string.4473": "If a person doesn’t dare reflect on himself, how could he ever earn others’ respect？.",
    "soso.string.4474": "Yo, big hero!",
    "soso.string.4475": "Everyone in the town is grateful to you!",
    "soso.string.4476": "All right, I’m sorry I couldn’t trust Rock‑Gallop.",
    "soso.string.4477": "Thanks to you two we managed to fell a demon we thought impossible to fell.",
    "soso.string.4478": "Life is still tough, but this situation is at least bearable.",
    "soso.string.4479": "What should I give you as a reward？ Oh—how about this？",
    "soso.string.4480": "《You received a Collectible》",
    "soso.string.4481": "This is my favorite short sword; in Sno, whoever carries it is my agent.",
    "soso.string.4482": "You’re the town’s hero! Wear it so everyone knows I’ve got your back!",
    "soso.string.4483": "Celebrate! Though there’s lots to do tomorrow, at least today let’s forget everything and relax. Cheers!",
    "soso.string.4484": "Good timing, brother. I called you today to ask a favor.",
    "soso.string.4485": "A lot has happened in the village lately.",
    "soso.string.4486": "Being short‑handed is quite a serious problem.",
    "soso.string.4487": "So we’ve decided to seek support from the lord.",
    "soso.string.4488": "The mithril mine here is an important source of ore for the nation.",
    "soso.string.4489": "There is no garrison because it’s far from the border and no highly aggressive monsters dwell here.",
    "soso.string.4490": "But now it’s different; even though you felled that terrifying demonfolk in Hafos Village.",
    "soso.string.4491": "we’re still at a total loss regarding the surging undead problem.",
    "soso.string.4492": "Relying only on hired adventurers and the Security Corps’ regular subjugations—the pressure is enormous; one slip and it all collapses.",
    "soso.string.4493": "Although the village must shoulder the payroll burden brought by a garrison, in the long run that hurts development.",
    "soso.string.4494": "But we have no choice now, right？",
    "soso.string.4495": "Now to the point: this is a handwritten letter from the village chief.",
    "soso.string.4496": "We need someone to deliver it to the lord.",
    "soso.string.4497": "The road passes through the Mengteng Mountain Range, and word from caravans says....",
    "soso.string.4498": "recent bandit problems have been severe; several caravans already refuse to go.",
    "soso.string.4499": "Although things are stable for the moment, we can’t guarantee the future will be the same.",
    "soso.string.4500": "This letter needs a reliable person to quickly deliver it to the lord.",
    "soso.string.4501": "《You take the letter from Reg.》",
    "soso.string.4502": "I knew you would be willing to help.",
    "soso.string.4503": "Also… take these as your travel expenses.",
    "soso.string.4504": "《You take some supplies from Reg.》",
    "soso.string.4505": "Before setting out on your journey, you should greet the people you know, right?",
    "soso.string.4506": "I wish you a safe journey as well.",
    "soso.string.4507": "Don’t know where the ‘Church of the Holy Tree’ is? The quest log will guide you.",
    "soso.string.4508": "Hurry up! The Purification Squad is waiting for your potions.",
    "soso.string.4509": "The subjugation force is bound to win, and as the promising newcomer, of course you’ll be joining too!",
    "soso.string.4510": "Brother, it’s worth celebrating that you returned safely.",
    "soso.string.4511": "But the situation is rather severe—ever since you departed…",
    "soso.string.4512": "A new undead nest has appeared near the southern village of Harves.",
    "soso.string.4513": "Under the protection of the Holy Tree, undead have never appeared here before…",
    "soso.string.4514": "Why are they now appearing in such great numbers…?",
    "soso.string.4515": "This particular nest feels ominous…",
    "soso.string.4516": "The strike force couldn’t even push into the nest’s interior,",
    "soso.string.4517": "They’re clad in fine mithril gear, and even taking down one is extremely difficult.",
    "soso.string.4518": "And they keep coming endlessly—defeat one, and another appears.",
    "soso.string.4519": "With our strength, we can’t resolve this…",
    "soso.string.4520": "So we’ve left the defense work to the reinforcements from Seimen.",
    "soso.string.4521": "But that would make Snow nothing more than meat on the chopping block.",
    "soso.string.4522": "I need you to take out ten zombies wearing mithril gear.",
    "soso.string.4523": "Prove that Snow has enough self-defense capability.",
    "soso.string.4524": "I’m counting on you for this, brother.",
    "soso.string.4525": "You… no, you and Rockrush seem to have been doing quite a lot behind the scenes?",
    "soso.string.4526": "…Can you tell me about it?",
    "soso.string.4527": "…You won’t tell me?",
    "soso.string.4528": "…Come to think of it, ever since you came to town, I’ve received a lot of help from you.",
    "soso.string.4529": "…Surrounded by undead in the Deep Root Hollow, you took down the berserk undead.",
    "soso.string.4530": "In the battle with demons at Harves, I think you could have won on your own.",
    "soso.string.4531": "And now, at this moment of greatest crisis, you just happened to show up.",
    "soso.string.4532": "Is that a coincidence? I don’t think so—you came here with a purpose, didn’t you…",
    "soso.string.4533": "…Still won’t say? Is my strength really so unworthy of your trust? Then forget it.",
    "soso.string.4534": "You’re still carrying the short sword I gave you—if you still see me as a brother…",
    "soso.string.4535": "Then when you’re in danger, I’ll be sure to save you too.",
    "soso.string.4536": "See? You owe me one!",
    "soso.string.4537": "…Worried you’ll drag me into danger?",
    "soso.string.4538": "No… I’m already deeply involved. Tell me! The truth.",
    "soso.string.4539": "I see… you’re heading to the Lost Forest to end this, right?",
    "soso.string.4540": "You can do it, can’t you?",
    "soso.string.4541": "Then… I’ll do what I can, so you’ll never regret trusting me.",
    "soso.string.4542": "You’re alright, right…?",
    "soso.string.4543": "From the scouts’ report… you rushed into the camp.",
    "soso.string.4544": "Forgemaster: 「",
    "soso.string.4545": "Still the same—not very good at hiding.",
    "soso.string.4546": "Well… that’s how it is.",
    "soso.string.4547": "At least you escaped safely in the end… What did you go there for?",
    "soso.string.4548": "We just got back to Snow… unfortunately, we don’t know much about the situation here…",
    "soso.string.4549": "So seeing the camp destroyed by invading roots made us drop our guard…",
    "soso.string.4550": "Well then… let’s talk about the current situation…",
    "soso.string.4551": "Not long after you left town… I gathered the security force.",
    "soso.string.4552": "As expected, they quickly mobilized, suppressing Snow by force and searching for you.",
    "soso.string.4553": "Thanks to intel, most of the security force members escaped safely…",
    "soso.string.4554": "Now Snow is under the control of that brute Biaosu.",
    "soso.string.4555": "And the key point… a few days later, the lord came with a large army…",
    "soso.string.4556": "Then the camp collapsed, and the roots of the Holy Tree rampaged and tore it apart.",
    "soso.string.4557": "Countless monsters emerged from within… a scene like the end of days.",
    "soso.string.4558": "The stationed troops were drawn into the roots one after another, almost willingly…",
    "soso.string.4559": "Then they emerged from the roots transformed into monsters…",
    "soso.string.4560": "Fortunately, they seemed to retain their intelligence and didn’t attack people.",
    "soso.string.4561": "So we continued to lie low, waiting for the right moment…",
    "soso.string.4562": "If not for the intel you gave that day, things wouldn’t have gone so smoothly.",
    "soso.string.4563": "Thanks to that, we weren’t suppressed in ignorance and managed to secure reinforcements from the capital.",
    "soso.string.4564": "Soon, the Imperial Army will come to take down the lord and his men…",
    "soso.string.4565": "The only real concern is…",
    "soso.string.4566": "Two weeks ago… while in hiding, I saw the lord escort Priest Rockrush deep into the camp.",
    "soso.string.4567": "I believe the priest is still alive…",
    "soso.string.4568": "But… in the chaos of battle, I can’t guarantee it.",
    "soso.string.4569": "So I hope to rescue him before the subjugation force acts.",
    "soso.string.4570": "The land is torn apart by tangled roots…",
    "soso.string.4571": "Making it hard for me to search deeply…",
    "soso.string.4572": "Can I ask you to help rescue Rockrush?",
    "soso.string.4573": "Is that so? If he says so…",
    "soso.string.4574": "Then it must be necessary…",
    "soso.string.4575": "Perhaps he, like me, feels deeply the inadequacy of his own strength.",
    "soso.string.4576": "That time we went together to the transformed undead nest in the Holy Capital—Woten…",
    "soso.string.4577": "Witnessing the ancient warrior, the stationed army’s commander Biaosu… and your power…",
    "soso.string.4578": "That’s a height you can’t reach even after swinging a sword tens of millions of times…",
    "soso.string.4579": "I want to move forward with you just a little more… share a little more of the burden.",
    "soso.string.4580": "The subjugation army will arrive in two days—let’s meet him then.",
    "soso.string.4581": "Who would have thought…",
    "soso.string.4582": "That the Lost Forest, long a place of exile for sinners… could develop such a large village.",
    "soso.string.4583": "No historical records ever mentioned this…",
    "soso.string.4584": "It seems exiles gradually gathered here and built the village without notice.",
    "soso.string.4585": "And… this place is indeed connected to the sanctum.",
    "soso.string.4586": "Now the route into the sanctum is secured… what’s the next plan?",
    "soso.string.4587": "…There are no treants in this village.",
    "soso.string.4588": "I think they don’t know about this entrance.",
    "soso.string.4589": "The remnants resisting in Yeelte, the treants fighting demons in the fortress city of Seimen… and many reinforcements outside the Holy Spirit Tree Altar…",
    "soso.string.4590": "…I believe having this entrance known only to us is a huge advantage.",
    "soso.string.4591": "You mean to destroy the main gate…?",
    "soso.string.4592": "That’s right—if we seal the gate, then we’ll only need to deal with the few enemies inside the sanctum.",
    "soso.string.4593": "Makes sense… then our first objective is decided.",
    "soso.string.4594": "Let’s seize control of the gate together.",
    "soso.string.4595": "How’s the progress?",
    "soso.string.4596": "Yes, we successfully destroyed the gate. Everything fine outside?",
    "soso.string.4597": "This village really has no sign of treants—in fact… we even seem to be welcomed.",
    "soso.string.4598": "This is a potion from their shamans, with some peculiar power…",
    "soso.string.4599": "As long as there’s nothing strange, that’s good—securing the retreat route is up to you.",
    "soso.string.4600": "If there’s any change at the gate, please report it right away.",
    "soso.string.4601": "You successfully slew the Erosion‑Dragon....",
    "soso.string.4602": "Planning",
    "soso.string.4603": "Partner, your strength truly can’t be underestimated.",

    "soso.string.4612": "Had they known you had such strength, they probably wouldn’t have rashly made you an enemy.",

    "soso.string.4614": "Mty_、CHRBOF",
    "soso.string.4615": "And along the way you even stopped the revival of the Demon King, culprit of the Human–Demon War....",

    "soso.string.4619": "But you were not afraid of failure... you set out for Banena again to seek the ritual’s core.",
    "soso.string.4620": "In the decisive battle against the stationed legion—despite running into the Erosion‑Dragon and Biao Su, who wouldn’t die no matter how he was attacked.",
    "soso.string.4621": "jerrypig、Ryanyj",
    "soso.string.4622": "You still persevered, buying time until I broke the source of his regeneration.",

    "soso.string.4626": "You brought him down by your strength alone.",

    "soso.string.4713": "and then struck him down.",
    "soso.string.4714": "...!",
    "soso.string.4715": "I spared the eight clans’ chiefs and let them lead their people in retreat...",
    "soso.string.4716": "and at last ended the long Human–Demon War.",
    "soso.string.4717": "You should have killed them!",
    "soso.string.4718": "I firmly believe that beyond the label of demonfolk, they each have their own individuality.",
    "soso.string.4719": "I left the Holy Capital with them; the dead forest and the desert became their home.",
    "soso.string.4720": "For the survival of their race, they had no choice but to resort to plunder.",
    "soso.string.4721": "What a fine reason to rationalize war!",
    "soso.string.4722": "But in the eyes of the plundered, that’s nothing but an excuse!",
    "soso.string.4723": "You hate the demonfolk too, don’t you—you should become like me!",
    "soso.string.4724": "I offered human technology...",
    "soso.string.4725": "The Holy‑Tree Church, which reveres life and prosperity, has many techniques leveraging the land’s advantages.",
    "soso.string.4726": "So long as the demonfolk possess sufficient resources, there is no reason to start war again.",
    "soso.string.4727": "You’re insane!",
    "soso.string.4728": "I choose to believe...",
    "soso.string.4729": "that one day we can advance hand in hand.",
    "soso.string.4730": "No!",

    "soso.string.4740": "My, what a fierce expression.",
    "soso.string.4741": "Looks like this time you actually intend to face me, hm...",
    "soso.string.4742": "But I’ve spent a lot right now; that damned demonfolk had some strength...",

    "soso.string.4745": "Taixin: 「",
    "soso.string.4746": "So you’re here; then let’s go quickly!",
    "soso.string.4747": "Powerful monsters roam the Withered‑Soul Dead Desert!",
    "soso.string.4748": "We really can’t linger! To hunt monsters with Green‑Soul Stone lodes, the Mirage Desert Boar is the best choice.",
    "soso.string.4749": "Pick a boar that’s massive and looks like it eats a lot; butcher it to take the stones.",
    "soso.string.4750": "Wait—that one... what kind of monster is that.",
    "soso.string.4751": "I’ve never seen a monster this massive here before.",
    "soso.string.4752": "This behemoth undoubtedly arose from the aberration!",
    "soso.string.4753": "It noticed us—hide, quickly!",
    "soso.string.4754": "The Tree’s influence is growing; looks like there isn’t much time left!",
    "soso.string.4755": "We must finish the Green‑Soul Spell Bead as soon as possible—this crisis is also an opportunity!",
    "soso.string.4756": "A monster that huge is bound to be loaded with Green‑Soul Stone ore!",
    "soso.string.4757": "Hunt it and you can gather the materials necessary to complete the Green‑Soul Spell Bead!",
    "soso.string.4758": "Mm... Sacred Tree magic doesn’t work on them at all.",
    "soso.string.4759": "Bringing you along was indeed the right choice.",
    "soso.string.4760": "To conserve See‑Through Magic’s mana, I’ll only support with small spells next.",
    "soso.string.4761": "I probably won’t be of much help; the fighting’s up to you.",
    "soso.string.4762": "Ah—so it’s dead already, huh. Though that bear was a big obstacle for us too.",
    "soso.string.4763": "At times I even felt a trace of companionship toward it...",
    "soso.string.4764": "Is it surprising I showed up here？ We don’t let any happenings in the mountains, big or small, slip by.",
    "soso.string.4765": "Let alone a battle this fierce.",
    "soso.string.4766": "In the end you still ignored my advice and handed over the letter.",
    "soso.string.4767": "Let me guess—you’re here now because they want you to clear obstacles for their march, right.",
    "soso.string.4768": "And the next target is probably us, isn’t it.",
    "soso.string.4769": "We will not stop our raids.",
    "soso.string.4770": "Just as you have your mission to fulfill, I also have things I cannot but do.",
    "soso.string.4771": "Next time let us fight in the cave’s deepest part.",
    "soso.string.4772": "Never thought we’d meet again!",
    "soso.string.4773": "That day, after holding up the enemy pursuit for a while, I was subdued...",
    "soso.string.4774": "They had no intention of killing me... perhaps that is a taboo for those who have become monsters...",
    "soso.string.4775": "To our eyes they are undoubtedly monsters... but they still consider themselves human...",
    "soso.string.4776": "Killing without scruple... would make them lose their identity as human.",
    "soso.string.4777": "That’s probably how I survived—how ironic...",
    "soso.string.4778": "To reach today we stirred up a tide of undead...",
    "soso.string.4779": "so many innocent people were sacrificed... yet when it comes to killing with my own hands, I can’t do it...",
    "soso.string.4780": "Before long the Imperial Army’s subjugation unit will arrive...",
    "soso.string.4781": "When the time comes, I’ll trouble you to take me away... under the influence of their spellcraft this place is full of Sacred Tree mana...",
    "soso.string.4782": "And I can study their spellcraft at close range; I hope to stay here a while longer...",
    "soso.string.4783": "The subjugation operation will probably be the final deadline...",
    "soso.string.4784": "Whatever the result... it will be the last straw crushing their humanity...",
    "soso.string.4785": "Feels like it’s just a little short...",
    "soso.string.4786": "With a bit more time, I’ll grasp something...",
    "soso.string.4787": "No choice—the subjugation operation has already begun; we have to go.",
    "soso.string.4788": "Mm... this is far enough; let’s move.",
    "soso.string.4789": "You were dragged into the endless time‑space by the drifters and died.",
    "soso.string.4790": "Hee‑hee... hee‑hee‑hee.",
    "soso.string.4791": "Hee‑hee... closer...... hee‑hee‑hee.",
    "soso.string.4792": "The road ahead seems blocked...",
    "soso.string.4793": "Many monsters are barring the way....",
    "soso.string.4794": "With bodies thick as giant trees—they’re very abnormal foes...",
    "soso.string.4795": "So these are Treants... the private soldiers Lanwang brought to the Holy‑Spirit Tree Altar.",
    "soso.string.4796": "Then... it’s no accident they’re blocking us here—be careful... don’t take them head‑on.",
    "soso.string.4797": "Why... I can’t get away!.",
    "soso.string.4798": "Why won’t you stop hounding me!",
    "soso.string.4799": "The Eastern Deep Forest... the entry method？ But... please, don’t kill me!",
    "soso.string.4800": "No... you won’t kill me...? The smuggling route we Silver Wolf Bandits use to get into the Eastern Deep Forest...",
    "soso.string.4801": "It’s hidden in the water well at the center of Seimen; we knocked open a hole in the city’s sewer system.",
    "soso.string.4802": "And that hole connects to a natural cave in the Deep Forest; that’s how we smuggled ourselves out.",
    "soso.string.4803": "I’ve told you everything I can—let me go!",
    "soso.string.4804": "Salesperson: 「",
    "soso.string.4805": "The weapons here are a great fit for you! And be sure to check out the “Imperial‑style” enchantments... looking to ask about something？",
    "soso.string.4806": "Want Green‑Soul weapons？ Why would you want that kind of thing!",
    "soso.string.4807": "I suggest you stop asking around; those are weapons used by the demonfolk.",
    "soso.string.4808": "They were banned a year ago, and as an honored member of the Imperial Workshop how could I possibly...",
    "soso.string.4809": "No... except for that guy Zhonghua, can’t say—go find him; only a weirdo like that would still be stashing Green‑Soul weapons now.",
    "soso.string.4810": "Who knows what smuggling route that is!",
    "soso.string.4811": "The Eastern Deep Forest is crawling with terrifying monsters and demonfolk; who would want to go there.",
    "soso.string.4812": "Smuggling？ Rather than that, how about buying our Imperial‑style fine weapons.",
    "soso.string.4813": "Cheap and sturdy Imperial‑style weapons—buy now for just 100 Gold!",
    "soso.string.4814": "Powerful “Imperial‑style” enchantments; great for any class.",
    "soso.string.4815": "This weapon here suits you perfectly! Be sure to check it out.",
    "soso.string.4816": "What, seriously？ You’re still here!",
    "soso.string.4817": "So the Silver Wolf Bandits amount to just this; Lanwang is overly cautious...",
    "soso.string.4818": "Even if there were another Shunchang or two, it’d be no big deal!",
    "soso.string.4819": "In the end he’s just someone who refuses revenge and refuses power... ah, nothing!",
    "soso.string.4820": "Thank you for your service as Sno’s messenger.",
    "soso.string.4821": "You braved many hardships and handed over Sno’s—the Empire’s—crisis to us.",
    "soso.string.4822": "We will soon take over the undead problem in its entirety.",
    "soso.string.4823": "As for manpower shortages, second and third waves will arrive soon.",
    "soso.string.4824": "There’s nothing to worry about anymore.",
    "soso.string.4825": "Stand down; you and the town’s guard captain... talk with Reig.",
    "soso.string.4826": "You are no longer needed.",
    "soso.string.4827": "What is it you’re worried about？",
    "soso.string.4828": "Mining rights to the mithril mine？ Or the cost of garrisoning troops？",
    "soso.string.4829": "I’ve already said it: we don’t need you.",
    "soso.string.4830": "Do you currently have the spare capacity to mine enough mithril？.",
    "soso.string.4831": "As for the cost of the garrison, we can cover it by mining mithril on your behalf to earn the funds.",
    "soso.string.4832": "Beyond this, we will make no other demands.",
    "soso.string.4833": "Still not satisfied？ Fine, have you help drive out the undead.",
    "soso.string.4834": "Call Reig over! Let’s see how many undead you can help us expel!",
    "soso.string.4835": "Hmph, what a rare visitor!",
    "soso.string.4836": "What wind is blowing today that actually brought Bishop Rock‑Gallop here in person.",
    "soso.string.4837": "No... no need for hospitality; I am but a humble cleric.",
    "soso.string.4838": "I came today to confirm the information heard from",
    "soso.string.4839": "—the news I heard",
    "soso.string.4840": "It seems your garrison has looted quite a few artifacts from the underground ruins!",
    "soso.string.4841": "Those artifacts taken from the Holy Capital ─ Woden belong to the Holy‑Tree Church!",
    "soso.string.4842": "Of course we’re not asking you to hand them over for free; we...",
    "soso.string.4843": "Then you may leave. No matter the price, we will not hand them over!",
    "soso.string.4844": "...Are you sure about that？",
    "soso.string.4845": "This is not merely my view; it is also the view of Lord Lanwang, who governs this place!",
    "soso.string.4846": "Do you... realize that saying this is tantamount to declaring war on our Holy‑Tree Church？",
    "soso.string.4847": "Seizing our Church’s assets, and yet...",
    "soso.string.4848": "Hah, don’t make me laugh! So what if we declare war on you？ And here’s another bit of good news for you.",
    "soso.string.4849": "The cause of the Sacred Tree aberration you’ve been investigating all along—was orchestrated by us.",
    "soso.string.4850": "So you know the culprit？ And then？ What can you do to me？",
    "soso.string.4851": "Y‑you...",
    "soso.string.4852": "Only after we used sorcery to distort the Sacred Tree to this extent did your Holy‑Tree Church finally notice the anomaly.",
    "soso.string.4853": "It’s a far cry from the Holy‑Tree Church at the height of its power seventy years ago.",
    "soso.string.4854": "You think I’d be afraid to go to war with you？",
    "soso.string.4855": "You’d best remember what you said today...",
    "soso.string.4856": "No...",
    "soso.string.4857": "You stay!",
    "soso.string.4858": "...Lanwang has always been wary of you; you possess inexplicably great power and, for some reason, linger in this place.",
    "soso.string.4859": "At last I know your identity today: a warrior sent by the Holy‑Tree Church？",
    "soso.string.4860": "Presumably a very high‑level warrior at that... ordered to investigate the aberration？",
    "soso.string.4861": "It’s useless; at this stage nothing can be undone!",
    "soso.string.4862": "How about it？ Come to my side; since you want the map in my hands, that means...",
    "soso.string.4863": "you hold the key phrase to enter and exit the altar, right？ We also have the support of quite a few high clergy of the Holy‑Tree Church.",
    "soso.string.4864": "Yet none of us knows the key phrase; personally I hold your strength in high regard as well...",
    "soso.string.4865": "Sigh, still spouting delusions？",
    "soso.string.4866": "To have such strength yet waste it... listen!",
    "soso.string.4867": "Though they are much more compliant now, those people seventy years ago... no, from even earlier...",
    "soso.string.4868": "were plunderers of humankind; this is a history written in blood.",
    "soso.string.4869": "Forgiveness？ What a joke. Have you seen what Shunchang was like？",
    "soso.string.4870": "Soldiers like that will appear by the tens of thousands.",
    "soso.string.4871": "The demonfolk will soon be crushed by us.",
    "soso.string.4872": "Give me your answer again...",
    "soso.string.4873": "Hmph... so that’s your answer？",
    "soso.string.4874": "...Don’t play dumb; in Sno, the only one with the skills to pull this off is you.",
    "soso.string.4875": "Tight‑lipped, are we... Speak! Where did the map go!",
    "soso.string.4876": "Think I don’t dare do anything to you？! Even if you’re strong, to me you’re just a third‑rate hack.",
    "soso.string.4877": "Hey, hey! Don’t bully my member, okay...？",
    "soso.string.4878": "...You’re Reig？",
    "soso.string.4879": "This person was in the Security Corps dorm all last night, so there’s no way he could have come make trouble here.",
    "soso.string.4880": "...Or are you saying your mighty garrison could be infiltrated by a petty thief from the Security Corps—and even let him escape？",
    "soso.string.4881": "Hmph, slick talker; your testimony has no credibility!",
    "soso.string.4882": "No matter what, you insist on framing my member？",
    "soso.string.4883": "Exactly!",
    "soso.string.4884": "Then I will withdraw our request for aid!",
    "soso.string.4885": "You’ve gone too far! Though it will take some time, I will have the Imperial Capital dispatch a knight order to protect Sno.",
    "soso.string.4886": "We don’t need you here—beat it.",
    "soso.string.4887": "Are you sure？ While you wait for the knight order, quite a few victims will appear, you know!",
    "soso.string.4888": "How is that any different from now？ Right before my eyes a brother is about to die because of you.",
    "soso.string.4889": "...Fine, enjoy your little victory; now is not the time to clash head‑on with the Imperial center.",
    "soso.string.4890": "I won’t arrest the man, but",
    "soso.string.4891": "before long I’ll teach you a lesson.",
    "soso.string.4892": "Let’s go; this isn’t a convenient place to talk.",
    "soso.string.4893": "Mm... finally resolved!",
    "soso.string.4894": "Before anyone comes to interfere, quickly destroy the gate!",
    "soso.string.4895": "Behind this gate it’s all distorted...",
    "soso.string.4896": "Mm... but it will surely be repaired soon.",
    "soso.string.4897": "This only buys a little time; regroup a bit... we have to seize the Sacred‑Tree Altar’s control as soon as possible.",
    "soso.string.4898": "O mighty one with strength! How do you intend to resolve the Sacred Tree problem.",
    "soso.string.4899": "We demonfolk have a strong sense for mana.",
    "soso.string.4900": "In the western human domain, an enormous mana is stirring and transforming.",
    "soso.string.4901": "The Sacred Tree’s mana is shifting—turning into something dark and corrupt...",
    "soso.string.4902": "Humans seem to be planning to do something with the Tree’s mana, aren’t they？",
    "soso.string.4903": "Let humans solve human problems; now, tell me your solution...",
    "soso.string.4904": "Zombies... and Green‑Soul Stone？ You swore to resolve the aberration, yet your grasp of the aberration itself is this shallow？",
    "soso.string.4905": "...Burning the Sacred Tree outright is the fastest method, though I doubt you could accept that.",
    "soso.string.4906": "...Since I lost to you I’ll respect you, and offer some guidance.",
    "soso.string.4907": "You do need Green‑Soul Stone, but not merely to deal with zombies.",
    "soso.string.4908": "This aberration was wrought by dark sorcery.",
    "soso.string.4909": "Using the Sacred Tree’s mana to create zombies, then using the zombies as a medium to infect the Sacred Tree’s mana.",
    "soso.string.4910": "The infected mana then creates yet more zombies—a near‑endless perpetual‑motion mechanism.",
    "soso.string.4911": "If you won’t destroy the Sacred Tree, the source of the mana supply, then you can only destroy the sorcery.",
    "soso.string.4912": "However, every zombie is a core of the sorcery; only by eradicating all zombies simultaneously can the sorcery be lifted.",
    "soso.string.4913": "That’s impossible under normal circumstances—except... with a spell that uses Green‑Soul Stone as its core.",
    "soso.string.4914": "This spell is a forbidden curse that drains the target’s life and mana, cast at the Sacred Tree’s mana convergence point.",
    "soso.string.4915": "It can curse the Sacred Tree and all zombies that draw power from it at the same time.",
    "soso.string.4916": "Though it will leave a grievous scar on the Sacred Tree, it can eradicate all the sorcery.",
    "soso.string.4917": "Go find our army’s smith—Taixin; have him make you a Green‑Soul Spell Bead sufficient to serve as the spell’s core.",
    "soso.string.4918": "I heard that during the materials‑gathering you were attacked by a jet‑black giant beast.",
    "soso.string.4919": "Hmph, don’t flatter yourself! With your power, a mere oversized beast is no match for you.",
    "soso.string.4920": "But... as expected, the time left to us is short; the Sacred Tree’s tainted mana is spreading.",
    "soso.string.4921": "Wild animals that touch this mana will have their life‑force strengthened and become more ferocious.",
    "soso.string.4922": "Such terrifying beasts will keep appearing, and ever more frequently, so long as the Sacred Tree’s aberration is not stopped.",
    "soso.string.4923": "Let me confirm once more: “Do not use power to enslave humans; use power to protect them,” correct？",
    "soso.string.4924": "In recent years the demonfolk truly do live better than before; the clans of the Demon Generals... all the tribes have become far more prosperous.",
    "soso.string.4925": "To thrive even on this wild land was unthinkable in the past.",
    "soso.string.4926": "Learning human technology rather than plundering humanachievements—just this change alone produced such a transformation.",
    "soso.string.4927": "I can believe in the change you brought; the Sacred Tree’s crisis will be resolved by you.",
    "soso.string.4928": "All right. Let’s go; Taixin’s craft is no fraud—the Spell Bead must be finished by now.",
    "soso.string.4929": "Don’t keep him waiting too long!",
    "soso.string.4930": "It’s been a long time... if you’re here, it’s probably not good news...",
    "soso.string.4931": "...You couldn’t stop it？ It’s not your fault... I didn’t expect a human’s obsession to run so deep...",
    "soso.string.4932": "To raise his sync with the sorcery so high... he can never return to human form.",
    "soso.string.4933": "You... no—would you consider destroying the Sacred Tree？ This near‑obsessive human curse is steadily growing stronger.",
    "soso.string.4934": "On the way here you saw them as well—humans turned into Treants.",
    "soso.string.4935": "The Treants that appear in this pitch‑black forest are still weak... but you’ve met far stronger Treants... right？",
    "soso.string.4936": "The Treants at the Holy‑Spirit Tree Altar... no matter how you attack, it’s difficult to do any damage.",
    "soso.string.4937": "The closer they are to the Sacred Tree that is the source, the greater power the Treants gain.",
    "soso.string.4938": "And as the curse worsens, powerful Treants can move across a wider area.",
    "soso.string.4939": "Unless you eradicate the curse or annihilate the source, the Treants’ undying nature will not be lifted.",
    "soso.string.4940": "The eight Demon Generals are converging here, and together with you, you will surely accomplish what the previous Demon King never achieved.",
    "soso.string.4941": "...Very well, human—if you still wish to strive under that identity.",
    "soso.string.4942": "I’ve sent warriors and Taixin to seek Green‑Soul Stone for the war.",
    "soso.string.4943": "They’ll be back in a few days; if there’s suitable Green‑Soul Stone you’ll take it to make the core.",
    "soso.string.4944": "In the meantime, there are some supplies we need you to obtain from human society.",
    "soso.string.4945": "Ask Wange for the details.",
    "soso.string.4946": "Gate Guard: 「",
    "soso.string.4947": "Green‑Soul weapons？ Those are contraband—you dare ask me that to my face？",
    "soso.string.4948": "Pass through here？ No, that’s impossible.",
    "soso.string.4949": "Without the lord’s consent, no one passes this point.",
    "soso.string.4950": "Let alone your goal—mining Green‑Soul Stone？ That’s contraband.",
    "soso.string.4951": "No. You’re not getting through; scram and stop bothering me.",
    "soso.string.4952": "You have no right to pass!",
    "soso.string.4953": "Ahead is the demonfolk’s forest.",
    "soso.string.4954": "You need to obtain the lord’s approval.",
    "soso.string.4955": "Eeek─No!.",
    "soso.string.4956": "You managed to avoid fighting quite well...!",
    "soso.string.4957": "But should I say... as expected？ Sno is under their control now...!",
    "soso.string.4958": "Mm... along the way it’s all Lanwang’s monster Treant army...",
    "soso.string.4959": "...They aren’t even bothering to cover it up anymore...",
    "soso.string.4960": "Which means they no longer need to hide it—or...？...",
    "soso.string.4961": "Anyway, we need to gather some intel....",
    "soso.string.4962": "Please get intel from the stationed camp ─ Yerte...？",
    "soso.string.4963": "It’s a dangerous mission, but... I believe you can do it...",
    "soso.string.4964": "Up ahead... Lanwang’s army is garrisoned; the road to the Holy‑Spirit Tree Altar is blocked...",
    "soso.string.4965": "Seems they planned it... we have no choice but to pass this road....",
    "soso.string.4966": "Against an army like this... we really have no way, and we can’t expect reinforcements now...",
    "soso.string.4967": "Remember inside the Holy‑Spirit Tree Altar？ There are drifters inside—few, but they are there...",
    "soso.string.4968": "No... but there’s no helping it—we can only take a gamble!？.",
    "soso.string.4969": "Dealing with the drifters in the Forest of Lost Paths is asking to die... and you know that!.",
    "soso.string.4970": "No way？ You intend to talk with the drifters？.？",
    "soso.string.4971": "Talking with the drifters in the Forest of Lost Paths is suicidal... it’s not like you don’t know that!",
    "soso.string.4972": "No... but there’s nothing we can do—we can only bet it all!",
    "soso.string.4973": "Zhonghua: 「",
    "soso.string.4974": "Green‑Soul weapons？ Sadly, I don’t have any; the lord especially hates demonfolk‑related things!.",
    "soso.string.4975": "Every weapon is a tradition—ore‑processing technique, refined aesthetic design, and the artisan’s craftsmanship. If only I had Green‑Soul weapons to study.",
    "soso.string.4976": "Green‑Soul weapons are precious demonfolk‑technology research samples; unfortunately I can’t get my hands on them.",
    "soso.string.4977": "I really can’t get close to Green‑Soul weapons... that brat...",
    "soso.string.4978": "All right, I do have a Green‑Soul weapon on hand! That punk actually went around blabbing.",
    "soso.string.4979": "So what do you want？ Hand me over to the officers？ And have the weapon destroyed？",
    "soso.string.4980": "I don’t intend to hand it over for free... how about this.",
    "soso.string.4981": "Bring me ten tomb‑looted gold goods and ten mithril ingots, and I’ll hand you the Green‑Soul Sword I have.",
    "soso.string.4982": "You haven’t brought enough mithril ingots.",
    "soso.string.4983": "You haven’t brought enough tomb‑looted gold goods.",
    "soso.string.4984": "So you actually brought enough.",
    "soso.string.4985": "Fine. I only meant to give you a hard time—getting ten mithril ingots here is nearly impossible.",
    "soso.string.4986": "So you’re from Sno—no wonder. All right... we’ll honor the deal.",
    "soso.string.4987": "I’ll entrust this Green‑Soul Sword to you.",
    "soso.string.4988": "《You received the Green‑Soul Sword.》",
    "soso.string.4989": "This sword is a rare treasure seized from a felled Demon General during the Great War of the past.",
    "soso.string.4990": "Even among demonfolk settlements, Green‑Soul weapons are quite rare.",
    "soso.string.4991": "Take good care of it—don’t break it!",
    "soso.string.4992": "《A rapid knocking sound comes from afar.》",
    "soso.string.4993": "Seriously... so many visitors today... did you sell me out!",
    "soso.string.4994": "You actually notified the officers—bastard!",
    "soso.string.4995": "Are you the one who took down the general？",
    "soso.string.4996": "You do look quite capable.",
    "soso.string.4997": "Though the general is rather impulsive, in the realm of pyromancy he’s unquestionably among the top of the demonfolk.",
    "soso.string.4998": "The last time he was beaten head‑on within his own domain was decades ago.",
    "soso.string.4999": "Thanks to you I’ve got fresh material to tease him with again.",
    "soso.string.5000": "Looking for a Green‑Soul Spell Bead？ Of course... I’d love to say “sure” but...",
    "soso.string.5001": "But we lack both materials and tools; Green‑Soul Stone weapons are arms that only a few elites among the demonfolk can even wield.",
    "soso.string.5002": "Being able to use a Green‑Soul weapon at all is a symbol of status and strength...",
    "soso.string.5003": "...Why？ Because both processing and maintenance of Green‑Soul Stone are extremely difficult!",
    "soso.string.5004": "This isn’t me giving you a hard time... anyway, if you want the Green‑Soul Spell Bead, bring back materials for the processing tool from the Withered‑Soul Dead Desert: 『Gnaw‑Fox Razor Fangs ×14、Dead‑Domain honey ×3、Dead‑Soul Tree branches ×3』!",
    "soso.string.5005": "Looks like the materials are still a bit short!",
    "soso.string.5006": "That was fast! You’ve already gathered all the materials.",
    "soso.string.5007": "All strange stuff, right!",
    "soso.string.5008": "But the Green‑Soul Stone processing tool is made using exactly these things!",
    "soso.string.5009": "First... grind up these razor fangs taken from the Gnaw‑Fox!",
    "soso.string.5010": "These Gnaw‑Foxes are especially troublesome! They quietly blend into the environment, then strike out of nowhere.",
    "soso.string.5011": "Getting bitten by those fangs hurts, doesn’t it—these are fangs sharp enough to pierce a person straight through together with their metal armor.",
    "soso.string.5012": "Next is this honey—the life essence of Dead‑Soul Trees that grow in the desert.",
    "soso.string.5013": "It embodies a fierce will to live; pour it over the powdered fangs.",
    "soso.string.5014": "See! The ground‑up fang powder starts to grow and solidify with the surrounding powder.",
    "soso.string.5015": "The Dead‑Soul Tree is a wondrous species that can survive only in the desert; it draws nutrients from the earth without end.",
    "soso.string.5016": "If it grows outside the desert, its excessive absorption will instead cause it to self‑destruct.",
    "soso.string.5017": "Only the Dead‑Domain venom bees know how to obtain the pure life essence from these trees.",
    "soso.string.5018": "Final assembly... done! Here in the Withered‑Soul Dead Desert, life is made manifest...",
    "soso.string.5019": "A Green‑Soul Stone processing tool known only to the demonfolk... the method to make the Gnaw‑Fox Fang Pick!",
    "soso.string.5020": "With the processing tool ready, next is... the usual: go gather Green‑Soul Stone ore!",
    "soso.string.5021": "It’s Dead‑Soul Tree chyme taken from the intestines of a creature... in the desert... far stronger than the Gnaw‑Fox!",
    "soso.string.5022": "Go gather: 『Gnaw‑Fox Razor Fangs ×4、Dead‑Domain honey ×16、Green‑Soul Stone ore ×4』!",
    "soso.string.5023": "But... none of this will be usable.",
    "soso.string.5024": "Sigh... it will still suffice for making ordinary Green‑Soul weapons.",
    "soso.string.5025": "But as the casting core of a great spell—the Green‑Soul Spell Bead—it’s far from enough.",
    "soso.string.5026": "If you don’t believe me, pour this honey over the ore; it will stimulate the Dead‑Soul Tree chyme that creature chewed, digested, and compacted.",
    "soso.string.5027": "It will grow into higher‑density Green‑Soul crystal ore; then use the Gnaw‑Fox Razor Pick to chisel open the overly weak outer shell to obtain Green‑Soul Stone.",
    "soso.string.5028": "But even then it isn’t large enough... you’ll need to defeat an even stronger foe.",
    "soso.string.5029": "...All right! I’ll assist you—facing a strong foe calls for another pair of hands.",
    "soso.string.5030": "And if I’m with you, I can process the freshly mined Green‑Soul ore on the spot.",
    "soso.string.5031": "If you’re pressed for time, just call me anytime; I’ll adjust my gear for gathering!",
    "soso.string.5032": "Bring him down!.",
    "soso.string.5033": "That helped me a lot....",
    "soso.string.5034": "From the intel you brought back, I estimate that the tentacled monster is an aberration from the Root‑Burrow Deep Pit!",
    "soso.string.5035": "Originally I intended to seal it by invoking Shishu from the shamanic spell you brought back....",
    "soso.string.5036": "But using only the Sacred Tree element that humans aren’t adept with, it failed.",
    "soso.string.5037": "Humans are actually better at invoking the composite system of Shishu... sadly, too many methods have been lost.",
    "soso.string.5038": "No problem at all; let’s keep cooperating like this.",
    "soso.string.5039": "I’ll entrust the ritual core you obtained to you; it’s material transformed by implanting Shishu《Ghost‑Orchid》 into a corpse and then extracting it.",
    "soso.string.5040": "Though its performance is far below that of a complete Shishu, using it to seal the tentacled monster’s activity is a fairly standard operation.",
    "soso.string.5041": "Place the ritual core at the “altar,” and after detecting activity, activate the limiting function.",
    "soso.string.5042": "It feels less like blocking the enemy’s attacks and more like stopping its invasive assault....",
    "soso.string.5043": "Wahaha! Using the above method, it looks like we successfully restrained the tentacled monster!.",
    "soso.string.5044": "Then let’s do just that! Bring back some more Green‑Soul crystal ore so we can prepare to make a new Green‑Soul Spell Bead...",
    "soso.string.5045": "It seems using the Green‑Soul weapon is still a bit awkward; can you hand it to me and let me take a look？...",
    "soso.string.5046": "This kind of adverse reaction occurred when wielding the Green‑Soul weapon....",
    "soso.string.5047": "Applying 《Ghost‑Orchid》 to the living does indeed drive people mad—after all, it’s a mystic energy keyed to the dead... Fortunately this version is only a temporary processed product.",
    "soso.string.5048": "The derangement is very likely due to insufficient invocation functionality; you can also see it doesn’t attune as well as it did for the previous Transformed one.",
    "soso.string.5049": "I’ll continue to make corrections—when facing that kind of terrible curse, lacking normal judgment... is the scariest thing of all...？",
    "soso.string.5050": "The revision will lean toward separation rather than fusion with the human body... which also means the spell bead will be easier for anyone to use....",
    "soso.string.5051": "Of course, it’s not that you can’t use a Green‑Soul weapon....",
    "soso.string.5052": "I personally prefer processing Green‑Soul Stone to craft suitable tools...",
    "soso.string.5053": "Supporting anomalous things like Green‑Soul Stone without fusing them into the human body....",
    "soso.string.5054": "Yet I don’t reject the hope that the final Green‑Soul Spell Bead could serve as a portable spring of cleansing—flowing outside the body and sipped in small amounts....",
    "soso.string.5055": "And when its sustained concentration is sufficiently pure and stable, it could fuse with any tool...",
    "soso.string.5056": "Mm... if we keep on like this... I think perhaps we can pull humanity out of the deep pit of curses....",
    "soso.string.5057": "Sorry... sorry... every time a warrior is swallowed by the curse... that soul that vanishes from then on...",
    "soso.string.5058": "I can’t help feeling... it’s somehow my fault....",
    "soso.string.5059": "Too many people have been swallowed up in this world... reducing the sacrifices is so hard...？",
    "soso.string.5060": "For this dying world, I’ll work even harder....",
    "soso.string.5061": "Judging from your corrections to the incantation text, you’re a genius; your learning ability really differs from the locals....",
    "soso.string.5062": "For now, keep cleansing the polluted mana from 《inside the camp》...",
    "soso.string.5063": "After that, send the child and their parents... to a place they can live....",
    "soso.string.5064": "If you find a village that will take them in... that would be wonderful...？",
    "soso.string.5065": "The “Volunteer Monks” will go take them away; that will do...!",
    "soso.string.5066": "Before you rescued me... the place I was about to be sent to was...",
    "soso.string.5067": "Someone will come take over—as long as we don’t get noticed by the very top... it won’t be a big problem...!",
    "soso.string.5068": "Then let’s leave here for now...!",
    "soso.string.5069": "One last time... let’s go back to Banena... and help the demonfolk....",
    "soso.string.5070": "Yes... on this chaotic land... besides humans... there are those who protect this world....",
    "soso.string.5071": "It’s just that this time... things are bad enough... that we can only pin our hopes on them...？",
    "soso.string.5072": "That really is... too dangerous....",
    "soso.string.5073": "Please... bring them hope...",
    "soso.string.5074": "You lot... the remnants...!",
    "soso.string.5075": "Are nothing but another group of aberrations....",
    "soso.string.5076": "Take what you need.......",
    "soso.string.5077": "I, a madman, want to take back my homeland... the pain brought by the curse is harsher than the outcomes people make up...？",
    "soso.string.5078": "At that time... I completely forgot those people weren’t you...",
    "soso.string.5079": "I’ll bear these mistakes...",
    "soso.string.5080": "My birthplace... just thinking of it... makes my chest... ache...!",
    "soso.string.5081": "Because... my homeland... was swallowed by the curse...？",
    "soso.string.5082": "Those towns on the snowfields... one after another... were swallowed...",
    "soso.string.5083": "Those people... the people... I saved no one...",
    "soso.string.5084": "If we want to turn that... into something else... somewhere people can settle... where children can cry...",
    "soso.string.5085": "Then... we have to... uproot the source of those curses.......",
    "soso.string.5086": "My homeland was destroyed by the undead; to take it back...",
    "soso.string.5087": "...I see； to stop these things from happening...",
    "soso.string.5088": "Our boss and members gave their lives to seal off the mountain range, and it still failed？",
    "soso.string.5089": "...Where exactly did we go wrong？ Since Lanwang took control of the Sacred Tree... the situation deteriorated all at once...",
    "soso.string.5090": "...Soldiers transformed into aberrations like the boss were sent in an endless stream from Sno to the Eastern Legion.",
    "soso.string.5091": "...Then, under the pretext of anomaly reconnaissance, they were sent into the Eastern Deep Forest to fight the demonfolk.",
    "soso.string.5092": "You want to ask me to lead you through the secret route to Banena once more...",
    "soso.string.5093": "But that’s a bit difficult... as the battle intensified, the demonfolk sealed the secret route on their side...",
    "soso.string.5094": "Leaving a path that might allow a strike from behind is too dangerous for them...",
    "soso.string.5095": "...This may be the war between humans and demonfolk in which humans have won the most.",
    "soso.string.5096": "But... without a doubt this is wrong； I’ll arrange for you to pass through the checkpoint into the Eastern Deep Forest...",
    "soso.string.5097": "Please stop all of this...",
    "soso.string.5098": "Well？ Did you reach Banena smoothly？",
    "soso.string.5099": "...It seems this batch of supplies is very important to them.",
    "soso.string.5100": "The things they asked us to collect before the secret route was closed...",
    "soso.string.5101": "A large amount of Recovery Potions and mithril ingots for crafting excellent gear.",
    "soso.string.5102": "But... it’s a bit too much; having you carry it all alone will likely hinder your movement.",
    "soso.string.5103": "Need my help...? Bring me along and I can lighten your load...",
    "soso.string.5104": "《Bring along》",
    "soso.string.5105": "《Leave behind》",
    "soso.string.5106": "All right... I’ll keep pace with you.",
    "soso.string.5107": "Mm, then I’ll trouble you all with transporting these supplies.",
    "soso.string.5108": "Very well... if you judge I’ll only hold you back.",
    "soso.string.5109": "Mm, then I’ll trouble you to carry these supplies; please make sure to deliver them to Banena.",
    "soso.string.5110": "Sigh, can’t be helped... entrusting such a huge load to just you alone.",
    "soso.string.5111": "That itself is foolish; we should have gauged an appropriate amount.",
    "soso.string.5112": "Sorry... I held you back; if you’d been able to fight at full strength without worrying about me, perhaps the result would be different.",
    "soso.string.5113": "You already did your utmost... as expected, it’s hard to send a huge load of supplies across the battlefield to Banena.",
    "soso.string.5114": "But... I truly didn’t expect Biao Su to appear on the battlefield—he was still commanding the stationed army in Sno days ago.",
    "soso.string.5115": "Running into him is nothing short of a disaster...",
    "soso.string.5116": "From your description... he seems to have power far beyond other Treants.",
    "soso.string.5117": "Something’s off; the Sacred Tree’s mana in the border region is much thinner than in Sno.",
    "soso.string.5118": "A Treant that strong shouldn’t be able to appear here yet—the Sacred Tree’s cursed mana is insufficient.",
    "soso.string.5119": "If he’s felled... especially by a Green‑Soul weapon wielded by a Demon General, his undying nature will collapse.",
    "soso.string.5120": "...At least for now we shouldn’t be facing him here.",
    "soso.string.5121": "Perhaps he has a mission—like subjugating an enemy general...？",
    "soso.string.5122": "Or pushing forward a suppressed front line... any way you look at it, it’s bad.",
    "soso.string.5123": "We must quickly re‑procure supplies to hand over to the demonfolk.",
    "soso.string.5124": "In the short term it’ll be hard to prepare a huge amount; just get 『Recovery Potions ×64, mithril ingots ×10』 for now.",
    "soso.string.5125": "That way your movement won’t be hindered.",
    "soso.string.5126": "I can brew the Recovery Potions; I can finish the preparations.",
    "soso.string.5127": "Then I’ll trouble you with the 『mithril ingots ×10』; hand them to me when ready so I can bundle them together.",
    "soso.string.5128": "We need 『10 mithril ingots』... I’m counting on you to get them.",
    "soso.string.5129": "Much appreciated... that should be enough supplies.",
    "soso.string.5130": "This time I’ll trouble you to transport alone—cut across the battlefield as fast as you can.",
    "soso.string.5131": "I have a bad feeling; maybe... it’s already too late.",
    "soso.string.5132": "...Fortunately you returned safely.",
    "soso.string.5133": "You successfully brought back the ritual’s core! That’ll be the best means to counter Lanwang...",
    "soso.string.5134": "...But our main helpers among the demonfolk, the Flame Clan, took a heavy blow.",
    "soso.string.5135": "Counting on further demonfolk support is now almost impossible...",
    "soso.string.5136": "A pity to lose their support... but it can’t be helped.",
    "soso.string.5137": "Mm... let’s go. Our bandit group has a secret path through the Mengteng Mountain Range to avoid the lord’s army.",
    "soso.string.5138": "Mm, big help. Let’s go...",
    "soso.string.5139": "...？",
    "soso.string.5140": "...You wouldn’t feel anything about Yuan‑Chuan’s death, would you—they’re demonfolk, not humans!",
    "soso.string.5141": "It’s only right they helped handle this; if it isn’t handled, Lanwang’s next target will be them.",
    "soso.string.5142": "...Don’t be foolish. If they could have smashed Seimen by force, they would’ve done it long ago. Helping our bandit group and you is only because they can’t.",
    "soso.string.5143": "It isn’t out of respect for us. All right... let’s go! We still have things we must do.",
    "soso.string.5144": "Having to compile reports constantly is a pain!",
    "soso.string.5145": "Running back and forth every day is exhausting.",
    "soso.string.5146": "I’m just a messenger—don’t take it out on me.",
    "soso.string.5147": "H‑huh, you’re back!",
    "soso.string.5148": "Even with Lord Yuan‑Chuan present, you looked weakened... so then.......",
    "soso.string.5149": "Gwah... utterly no match... are you really human......",
    "soso.string.5150": "Eek eek eek... spare me...... I only did it to survive...",
    "soso.string.5151": "Our bandit group used to be the Mengteng Mountain patrol unit... one day the boss brought back something unbelievable.",
    "soso.string.5152": "He was often ordered to support Biao Su’s Eastern Deep Forest patrol unit—maybe that’s why...",
    "soso.string.5153": "We learned... the demonfolk... the Sixth Demon General was about to attack Seimen.",
    "soso.string.5154": "That legendary monster was coming for us—we had no choice!!.",
    "soso.string.5155": "No hero, no champion; if they came now, we’d be finished.",
    "soso.string.5156": "The boss knew the situation, so he went to find Lanwang!",
    "soso.string.5157": "Then he came back covered head to toe in roots—hardly recognizable...",
    "soso.string.5158": "The boss said Lanwang had no intention of stopping or preventing the war...",
    "soso.string.5159": "Back then the Human–Demon War ended with the hero defeating the demonfolk...",
    "soso.string.5160": "and not with the annihilation of demonfolk...",
    "soso.string.5161": "Lanwang’s gone mad—his hatred for the demonfolk has driven him insane.",
    "soso.string.5162": "He’s pinning his hopes on an ominous power to kill all demonfolk.",
    "soso.string.5163": "Seeing the boss’s state, we knew we could defeat the demonfolk.",
    "soso.string.5164": "But we would no longer be human.",
    "soso.string.5165": "The boss made his decision—to join hands with the demonfolk and fulfill their demand.",
    "soso.string.5166": "Then, sneak back into the sewers; I’ll arrange for you to meet Lord Yuan‑Chuan.",
    "soso.string.5167": "As Lanwang said... that dragon...",
    "soso.string.5168": "so long as it still lives in the world, the ritual’s power won’t be enough to eradicate the curse...",
    "soso.string.5169": "...!!",
    "soso.string.5170": "We’ve been tailed again...？...",
    "soso.string.5171": "Sss...",
    "soso.string.5172": "Wait... something’s wrong!",
    "soso.string.5173": "Gah!",
    "soso.string.5174": "...The curse has slipped free of human control.",
    "soso.string.5175": "Again!!",
    "soso.string.5176": "What do we do—the monsters are still pouring out!",
    "soso.string.5177": "Hold the ritual...! Use the ritual’s power to purge the cursed monsters...",
    "soso.string.5178": "Reig, Kadon, Wange—the monsters breaking into the ritual site are yours to deal with!",
    "soso.string.5179": "I’m counting on you... go bring down the Erosion‑Dragon!",
    "soso.string.5180": "Only you can do this—please, end it all!",
    "soso.string.5181": "We’re counting on you... I believe you can do it!",
    "soso.string.5182": "The holding unit has already started moving.",
    "soso.string.5183": "Next we just have to rendezvous with Duanxian.",
    "soso.string.5184": "Let’s go; we can’t afford any delay.",
    "soso.string.5185": "I often hide behind the door.",
    "soso.string.5186": "I am an anomaly different from them—a wholly different existence.",
    "soso.string.5187": "I am unwelcome among them—a despised existence.",
    "soso.string.5188": "Some adults look at me as if they’re seeing filth.",
    "soso.string.5189": "But the Pontiff is different.",
    "soso.string.5190": "But I have companions by my side.",
    "soso.string.5191": "Therefore I drew my sword to face them, without a shred of hesitation.",
    "soso.string.5192": "The supplies seem a bit heavy...",
    "soso.string.5193": "But getting across the battlefield to Banena is still no problem...",
    "soso.string.5194": "My strength is slight, but I will also help fight the Treants.",
    "soso.string.5195": "If we give up fighting out of fear... everything ends.",
