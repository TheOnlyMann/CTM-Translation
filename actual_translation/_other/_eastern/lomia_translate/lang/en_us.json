    "item.book.2.page.1": "The history of Britodenek can be divided into four categories: the beginning period, the construction period, the unborn period, and the divine period. This book explains what happened in these times.",
    "item.book.2.page.2": "Long before Britodenek was created, there was an empty space in the world. There were nine gods in the space. A God cooperated and proposed to create a world in that space. The two Gods agreed with the proposal, and the rest of them decided to create their own world.",
    "item.book.2.page.3": "And this world, Britodenek was created by the creator gods Denek, Aera, and Order. First Denek created the earth. Aera then planted the species of the creature in the ground. Finally, the order gave the world a chance to move. This was the beginning of Britodenek, and it continued for thousands of years.",
    "item.book.2.page.4": "When Britodenek was completed and the construction period entered, the gods created us humanity. Humanity worshiped the three gods, created a nation, and lived in harmony. Around this time, the remaining six gods also completed their own unique world, Realm.",
    "item.book.2.page.5": "However, the world created by the six gods was a world where there was something missing compared to Britodenek. The six jealous gods began to trouble with Britodenek's humanity. A god spread fear. A god spread the illness. As a result, the six gods became known as evil gods.",
    "item.book.2.page.6": "Angry at this, Denek, Aera and Oder attempt to protect Britodenek. Don't be out of control, the evil gods began an invasion of Britodenek. The conflict between the gods intensified, and in the end all of the gods died out. Later this war was called the divine war. This concludes the construction period with approximately 2,000 years of history.",
    "item.book.2.page.7": "After that, Britodenek was a period known as the bryonation period for about 800 years. Humanity somehow survived without God's protection. As a result, technical improvements in the creation of magic and tools, and a culture similar to ours today has been created.",
    "item.book.2.page.8": "Then, in the last year of the brink of confusion, an incident called the Fragment Warfare occurs. Amorasac, a god who was thought to have been perished, was resurrected and began an invasion of Britodenek. Fortunately, however, the fragment turmoil was halted by Tonem Gulf heroes.",
    "item.book.2.page.9": "After the fragmentary upheaval, Genesis revealed that all Gods were alive. And Genesis God rejoices in that humans live alone in their own power, and at the same time explains that God's blessing is not necessary. The brink of breach came to an end, promising to remove only the calamities that were plagued by the evil gods.",
    "item.book.2.page.10": "Since then, strangers who have washed away from illnesses and realms have continued to be removed by the Genesis God. If you become ill, you will be cured immediately by praying to the Genesis God in the church.",

    "item.book.3.page.2": "Krosis\nThe end of the priest who served Amorasac. Fight with nature such as ice and thunder as your allies. A simple man who likes to fight against strong people. If we can launch a smash attack, we might have a chance to win.",
    "item.book.3.page.3": "Brunik\nA insidious man who likes traps, symmetrically with Krosis. Apparently he originally served Romia's god of disaster, but his insidious personality made him a fragment of Luzekolap.

He uses a variety of techniques besides blood sucking, such as manipulating corpses and transforming into bats.

    "item.book.3.page.6": "Divon\nA tentacle creature that is said to have been created by Luze Colap. It absorbs living things and inorganic matters regardless of whether they are living things or inorganic things, and grows to a massive extent. However, his intelligence was low and the evil gods seemed to be having trouble dealing with them. Apparently it is usually sealed somewhere in the desert of the Thia region.",
    "item.book.3.page.7": "Agnax\nA fragment born when an evil god gives power to a spirit that lived in primitive volcanoes. It is a snake-like monster with a magma-like head and a tail of flame, and it flies through the air and attacks humans. It's a flame monster, so there's no guarantee that, but water may be his weakness.",
    "item.book.3.page.8": "Armored Squid\nApparently Lacolondo is a modified version of a giant squid. It appears to be made using a technology that does not exist in Britodenek, and each attack is strange.\nIt seems that it can only appear in the sea, so it's not a problem as long as you don't get close to the sea.",
    "item.book.3.page.9": "Hadrim\nThe immortal demon dragon born after Bahaus by Amorasak. Compared to Bahaus, it was a very troublesome fragment.

    "item.book.4.page.2": "For example, it is said that there are Karakuri dolls in Lacolonde's Realm and Mad Garage that cannot be created using Britodenek's technology. For example, the realm of Luze Collup, the Darkswamp, is said to have a jewel that can cure any disease.",

    "item.book.5.author": "Armin Otomeier",
    "item.book.5.page.1": "It is said that humanity was born in Britodenek at the beginning of the construction period, and as the runner-up in the 204 period of the Kamisei era, humanity was said to have flourished for about 3,000 years. However, in Marbeon, a jungle-closed land, something strange has been discovered that could overturn this history.",
    "item.book.5.page.2": "Ruins made of white quartz were discovered in a cave that was accidentally discovered while building a new town in Marbenon. There are many creepy and strange things in this ruin.",
    "item.book.5.page.3": "First, let's talk about architecture using white quartz. Processing white quartz is extremely difficult, and in the last 100 years or so, technology has finally been established to make it into accessories. Despite this, the site uses white quartz as its building material.",
    "item.book.5.page.4": "Furthermore, according to literature written at the beginning of the construction period, there were jungles around the Marbenon ruins from that time, and although there were tribes that hunted nuts and animals, no advanced civilization existed.",
    "item.book.5.page.5": "When this site was discovered, the inside of the site was occupied by goblins. Could the goblins have built this sophisticated civilization? Some were long before the construction period...for example, did a civilization already exist in the early days than it is now? The mystery only deepens.",

    "item.book.6.author": "Tonem Gulf Publishing",
    "item.book.6.page.1": "In the last year of the era of breach, the God of Genesis was resurrected. At that time, the God of Genesis was told that the evil god was active. He then revealed the existence of the hero who fought for Britodenek. This story is about an unnamed hero who fought alone against a resurrected evil god.",
    "item.book.6.page.2": "In his last year of unbornness, a man was captured in prison in Tonem Gulf. It is said that only Duke Latrond, Duke of Tonemgulf at the time, was known to him. The Duke of Latrond gives a certain mission on the condition that the prisoner is released. The mission is to destroy the weapon fragments used by the evil gods in mythological warfare.",
    "item.book.6.page.3": "The prisoner agreed to this mission and upon his release he headed to a place called the ancient catacomb. There he fights against the end of the priest called Crosis. He fought bravely with his sacred treasures from the Mythic War era, which had been sealed in the catacombs. The fierce battle shattered the sacred treasures, but the prisoners successfully defeated Crosis.",
    "item.book.6.page.4": "He then defeats the warrior Brunik, who was sealed in the forest of corpses, the demon dragon Bahaus, who was sealed in the scars of the earth, the vampire king Dinok, who was sleeping in the witch's hideout, the tentacle creature Divon, who was sealed in an abandoned desert, and the ancient spirit Agnax, who was imprisoned in a primitive volcano.",
    "item.book.6.page.5": "And the Duke of Latrond orders him to fight Amorasac, the king of destruction, as the final condition for the prisoners to be completely free. The man was dressed in Kongagulite armor and used his numerous Noble Phantasms, swords and intelligence to defeat Amorasac. The prisoners will then be told as heroes of Tonem Gulf in later life.",
    "item.book.6.page.6": "However, no one knows what's going on. The Duke and the Hero disappeared after this battle. Now I don't know where he went or why he disappeared from the city without telling anyone. The author of this book speculates that the Duke of Latrond, fearing power, was attempting to assassinate the Tonemgulf heroes in a bid.",
    "item.book.6.page.7": "In this book, the hero of Tonem Gulf is considered a man, but it is not known at all whether he was actually a woman or how old he was. This story is also reproduced based on fragmentary information obtained from the townspeople of Tonemgulf after the resurrection of the God of Genesis. In any case, the truth is in the darkness.",
    "item.book.7.title": "Third Gods",
    "item.book.7.author": "Meera Baro",
    "item.book.7.page.1": "The God of Genesis who created Britodenek, and the evil god who frequently threatens Britodenek. Many people believe that there are only two types of gods in the world. However, there is a god in the frontier of Britodenek that does not belong to either of these gods. This book introduces such gods.",
    "item.book.7.page.2": "Romia's God of Disaster\nA god worshiped in Romia, a desert town in the Thia region southwest of Britdenek. The official name was forgotten in ancient times. He once worried about people who had forgotten himself, he committed an incident in which all the people in the city were taken away at Romire, during the construction period. From then on, he has been worshiped as the guardian deity of Romia.",
    "item.book.7.page.3": "Steio\nA god of knowledge worshiped in the Primara region of the east of Britodenek. He is a purely exploring knowledge, and seems to have no interest in anything other than to acquire new knowledge. He originally seemed to have been a human scholar who was enthusiastic about research, but after being caught up in the war of divine exploits and died, he became like a earthbound spirit, and it seems to have continued to this day.",
    "item.book.7.page.4": "Romia's god of disaster and Steio are indigenous gods worshiped in the provinces. However, the gods introduced on the following pages only have names in old books, and there is little information about what their properties have. Perhaps he is the god of fantasy thought up by ancient people.",
    "item.book.7.page.5": "Rumo\nThe god who controls light. The name was listed in a book discovered at the beginning of the construction period, that is, immediately after the birth of humanity. The book does not exist, but if true, it means that before humans were born, there existed an organism that could manipulate the same language as in modern times. Or was the book written by God?",
    "item.book.7.page.6": "Marspelo\nThe god who controls darkness. His name was listed in the same book as Rumo. These two pillars are said to control light and darkness, but perhaps they have the power to far surpass the God of Genesis and the evil gods? Despite this, its existence has not been confirmed. The mystery only deepens.",

    "item.book.8.page.3": "The man, who was feeling well, said he wanted to give back to the village. However, the villager informed the village of the current situation and encouraged the man to leave the village immediately. Then the man began to put Karakuri, which he had never seen before, all across the village. As the tactile movements, crops grew in the village fields and water erupted in the wells.",
    "item.book.8.page.4": "The man stayed in the village for a while, enriching the village with techniques that he had never seen or worked. The village has grown to a size that could be called a small town. And after a while the village became a town, the man disappeared.",
