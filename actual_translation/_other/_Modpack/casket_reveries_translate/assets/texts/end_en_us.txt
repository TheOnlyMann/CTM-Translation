——§l§6《The Casket of Reveries · Epilogue》§r——

§bThrough the waxing and waning of celestial rivers, an otherworldly traveler descended.

From the empyrean came a wanderer named 「PLAYERNAME」, who trod upon rainbows and descended upon the isolated island sanctuary.

Within the sanctuary stood a goddess clad in pristine white, who proclaimed him the prophesied §6「Bringer of Dawn」§r, charging him to gather the embers of heroic spirits across the realms. She declared: 「When flames converge, light shall prevail; when light triumphs, corruption shall be cleansed, and the Black Tide purified.」

PLAYERNAME traversed nine seas, scaled countless peaks, recovered fragmented souls from crumbling cliffs, and gathered lost embers in forsaken abysses—until at last, all flames were returned to the sanctuary.

At that moment, the altars ignited one by one, pillars of light piercing the heavens like the wings of a golden crow taking flight.

§cYet suddenly the halls trembled, the jade steps drowned in darkness—the goddess shed her mortal guise and revealed her true form: she was §d「Mortis, the Goddess of Death」§c, her eyes like wells of oblivion, her hair flowing like the rushing night.

In ages past, the sanctuary had been a seal against demons. Mortis led the Black Tide to assault it, and the original guardian, Lord Xihe, burned his very essence to imprison her soul. The vessels of the demonic gods shattered throughout the corridors, their echoes scattered to the winds.

A fragment of Mortis’s spirit remained, weaving false prophecies to lure the celestial traveler into aiding her rebirth. What she called “embers of heroic spirits” were in fact echoes of demonic gods; what she named a “ritual of purification” was in truth a key to break the seal.

§bAlas! A centuries-old scheme had become a prison of death; a journey of a thousand miles ended as a feast for the demon god.

§6The Grand Historian remarks: The world trusts what the eyes see, yet the line between god and demon lies in the subtleties of the heart. Only when the celestial traveler broke the cycle did he understand—what lies entombed within the Casket of Reveries is not a soul of the departed. When the stars turn once more, one shall come riding the waves to fulfill the covenant yet unfinished.

§b「Light is not light, gloom not gloom; the stardust lights the path for those who follow. When the Casket of Reveries opens, the moon shall shine clear.」
