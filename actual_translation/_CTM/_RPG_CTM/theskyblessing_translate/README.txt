P.S.
ProjectTSB started in August 2020, and took many years to develop.
As such, we are truly proud to finally and officially release The Sky Blessing to the public.
However, this would not be possible with the TSB Team alone.
We would also like to offer our heartfelt thanks to our betatesters, those who reported bugs and provided technical support, those who supported us, and those who've been patiently waiting for our map's official release. It truly means a lot to us all.

ProjectTSB は 2020 年 8 月に始まり、開発チームは長い月日をかけて TSB の開発に取り組んできました。
その結果、これほどの配布マップを正式リリースできたことを大変嬉しく思います。
しかしながら、この結果は開発チームのみでは成し遂げられなかったことです。
β 版をプレイして間接的に応援してくださった方々、バグ報告や実装の手助け、支援など直接的に開発を支えてくださった方々、正式リリースまでお待ちいただいた全て方々に、この場を借りて感謝申し上げます。

Translator's Note:
Sequex here! This map took many long months (and many technical mishaps) to not only fully translate, but to also provide proper translation support for anyone else willing to translate the map. With well over 50k JP characters, nearly 4k translate keys, and a truly complex datapack to wrangle, this was no easy task to undertake. It's my honor to finally bring this project to the English-speaking community of Minecraft!
This localized release is maintained solely by me with no affiliation with the original team behind the project. If you spot any issues, wish to translate the map, or simply want to have a chat, you can contact me on Discord (sequex) or through the respective Planet Minecraft or Minecraftmaps page.
